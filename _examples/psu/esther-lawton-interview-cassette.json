title: Esther Lawton: oral history cassette
source: Pennsylvania State University
description: Goal of modeling an analog component which has a digitized form as well. This record is for an oral history interview on an audiocassette that's part of a larger collection. Using RDA here to choose the word audiocassette. I used the finding aid URI as standin for item-level analog URI. I wondered about adding a playerType property but eventually decided against it because it's not in our description. See also a modeling of the digital object as esther-lawton-interview-digital.json.
